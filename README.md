# DeployWorkstation v2.0 (Testing)

*This is a testing edition of the Version 2 I hope to release; which will allow this process to be compeleted for any/all user accounts on a Windows system.

DeployWorkstation is a PowerShell-based, zero-touch provisioning toolkit proof of concept for Windows 10 & 11 workstations. 
Whether you‚Äôre imaging bare metal or cleaning up an existing PC, DeployWorkstation handles the heavy lifting of standard software and Apps removal, as well as basic application installations.
DeployWorkstation turns what used to be a 30-60 minute manual process into a single ‚Äúplug-and-play‚Äù operation, saving you valuable time on every workstation you configure. Feel free to fork, tweak the app list/script, and contribute back!  

- **Self-elevating & policy-bypassing**  
  Automatically relaunches under Windows PowerShell 5.1 with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` and UAC elevation, so you can double-click or run a single .cmd wrapper without tweaking system settings.

- **UWP ‚Äúbloatware‚Äù purge**  
  In one Desktop-PowerShell pass it uninstalls and de-provisions built-in apps like New Outlook, Clipchamp, Family Safety, OneDrive, LinkedIn, Copilot, Teams, Skype, Xbox, and more.

- **Win32/Msi removal & DISM cleanup**  
  Removes legacy features (Quick Assist, Remote Desktop, Mixed Reality, Game Bar, etc.) via WinGet, DISM and registry, and uninstalls enterprise software such as McAfee by parsing their UninstallStrings from the registry.

- **Standard app install via WinGet**  
  Installs your golden image of third-party tools (Malwarebytes, BleachBit, Chrome, .NET Runtimes, Java, Adobe Reader, Zoom, 7-Zip, VLC, etc.) in parallel or sequentially, with silent-install flags and built-in error logging.

- **Offline fallback support**  
  Bundles proprietary installers (MSIs/EXEs) on USB and runs them silently if Winget can‚Äôt reach the network or community feed.

- **Centralized logging & pause-for-review**  
  Writes a detailed `DeployWorkstation.log` in its script folder and pauses at the end so you can inspect any errors or warnings before rebooting.

## Usage
1. **Copy** the `DeployWorkstation.ps1` and its `.cmd` launcher onto your USB or network share.  
2. **Double-click** the `.cmd` (or run `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\DeployWorkstation.ps1`) to start.  
3. **Let it run** unattended!
4. When it finishes, it will pause for review and reboot for a clean, ready-to-use machine.

# With parameters
.\DeployWorkstation-AllUsers.ps1 -SkipAppInstall -LogPath "C:\Logs\deploy.log"

# Skip certain sections

    # Existing apps...
    @{ Id = 'Publisher.AppName'; Name = 'Display Name' }
)
```

winget list
```

### Via GUI

## üö´ Installation Failures
Common reasons for installation failures:

- **Permission Issues**: Lack of administrator privileges
- **Package Conflicts**: Existing installations interfering
- **Corporate Policies**: Group policies blocking installations

## üìà Success Optimization
For best installation success rates:
1. **Run as Administrator**: Always use elevated privileges
2. **Disable Antivirus**: Temporarily disable real-time protection
3. **Stable Connection**: Ensure reliable internet connectivity
4. **Clean System**: Run on freshly installed Windows when possible
5. **Check Logs**: Review installation logs for troubleshooting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
1. **Irreversible Changes**: Many of these removals require Windows reinstallation or manual restoration to undo.
2. **Future Users**: Settings applied to the default user profile affect all newly created user accounts.
3. **Provisioned Packages**: Removing provisioned packages prevents automatic installation for new users.
4. **Enterprise Considerations**: Some disabled services may be required in enterprise environments.
5. **Gaming Impact**: Xbox-related removals will affect Windows gaming features and Game Bar functionality.

## üîÑ Restoration
To restore removed functionality:
- **UWP Apps**: Reinstall from Microsoft Store
- **Windows Features**: Re-enable via "Turn Windows features on or off"
- **Services**: Re-enable via `services.msc`
- **Registry Settings**: Manual registry editing required
- **McAfee**: Download and reinstall from McAfee website
